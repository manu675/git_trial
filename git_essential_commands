HOW TO PUSH CODE TO GITHUB

# step 1) create a new repository on github 

# the remote repository URL is:
https://github.com/manu675/git_trial.git

# step 2) open the terminal

# get and locate the present working directory

pwd

## the current wd is /Users/Manu


# step 3) set your local project as the current working directory

cd /Users/Manu/Documents/GitHub/git_trial

# the ls command shows all the files contained in the current wd

ls

# step 4) initialize the local directory as a git repository

git init

# step 5) add files to your new local repository 
# (files are staged for a commit)

git add . # we stage all files in the current wd for a commit

# alternatively, we can add/stage a single file for a commit
# using git add <filename>

# we check all files that are staged for a commit

git status

# step 6) commit the files you have staged in your local repository
# -m "message" is optional and adds comment to the commit

git commit -m "first commit"

# step 7) add the URL for the remote repository where your local repository
# will be pushed to

git remote add origin https://github.com/manu675/git_trial.git

# step 8) push the code in your local repository to Github 

git push -u origin master

# you will have to enter your github username and password or connect VS Code

# step 9) double check that your file appear in the remote Github repository
